11/16/2023: Similar to Hurah Island, these Unity games are just too large.
11/17/2023: The goal with this text file is to keep track of my updates without actually taking up space on Github. Using lfs is not enough and I am not able to pay for the extra storage. So this will do for now. I plan on updating the readme as well, and if you'd like to see or work on the project, feel free to contact me, I would very much appreciate it.
11/28/2023: The first version of the game has been released to itch.io under the name Golf Game. This is a great first step towards releasing it for the public, and I will continue to make updates for it.
11/30/2023: I have finally found the problem I have been battling for a very long time. The Scene Manager was in fact loadign the correct level, but there were too many balls in the level. Ultimately confusing the selector of which ball to consider in action. Removing the excess allowded for each level to play as expected. Now to move onto a few other small things, like why the ball likes to clip through the playing field sometimes.
